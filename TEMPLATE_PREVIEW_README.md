# Template Preview Feature

## Overview

The Template Preview feature allows users to view how each template will look with sample content before making their selection. This helps users make informed decisions about their portfolio design.

## How It Works

### 1. **Template Selection in Dashboard**
- Users navigate to the **Appearance** panel in their dashboard
- Three template options are displayed: Basic, Axis, and Eclipse
- Each template card shows a placeholder image and description

### 2. **Preview Links**
- Each template card has a **"Preview Template"** button
- Clicking this button opens the template in a new tab with mock data
- The preview shows exactly how the template will look with real content

### 3. **Mock Data**
- All templates use the same comprehensive mock profile data
- Includes realistic projects, skills, education, experience, and more
- Shows the full potential of each template
